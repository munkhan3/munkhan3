## üîé &nbsp; Current Interests
### Research 
**In general**, I am interested in analyzing numerical approximations to systems of equations in terms of error, efficiency, and ease of implementation. Specifically, I am interested in studying models of randomly-evolving systems such as those in finance and medical physics.  

**Currently**, I am focusing on stochastic simulations of system models in finance. My current research project is titled *Forecasting Options Prices via Stochastic Simulations of the Heston Model* and involves discretizations of Brownian motion, explicit numerical methods for stochastic processes, and Monte-Carlo simulations.
